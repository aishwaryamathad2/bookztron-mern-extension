# Bookztron – MERN Stack Online Bookstore (Educational Project)

This project is an educational MERN stack extension of an open-source **frontend-only** bookstore UI originally created by:
https://github.com/Naman-Saxena1/Bookztron-E-Commerce_Book_Store

The original project focused on the **React frontend with mock/static data**.  
I extended the project by designing and implementing a **complete backend and real database integration**, converting it into a full MERN application.

## My Contributions (Major Work)

### Backend Development
- Built a complete backend using **Node.js and Express**
- Designed and integrated a **real MongoDB database (MongoDB Atlas)**
- Created Mongoose schemas and models for:
  - Users
  - Books
  - Proposals
- Implemented full **CRUD operations** using REST APIs

### Authentication & Authorization
- Implemented **JWT-based authentication**
- Role-based access control:
  - User
  - Author
  - Publisher
  - Admin
- Secured routes using middleware

### Application Features
- Backend-powered authentication (Signup/Login)
- Real cart and checkout logic
- Book management (add/update/delete)
- Author and Publisher dashboards
- Admin management features
- Proposal handling system
- API integration between frontend and backend

### Frontend Enhancements
- Integrated frontend with backend APIs
- Updated authentication flow to use real backend data
- Improved and extended existing UI features
- Added new pages and components to support backend functionality
